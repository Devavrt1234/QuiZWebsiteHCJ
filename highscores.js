// Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability: LocalStorage shares many characteristics with cookies, including security risks. If a website is vulnerable to XSS attacks, LocalStorage can be exploited. Hackers can steal cookies and masquerade as a user with their login session for that site. Storing sensitive information like passwords in LocalStorage simplifies this process for attackers1.
// Lack of Control: Unlike server-side storage, LocalStorage doesnâ€™t provide developers with control over the stored data. Once data is stored, developers cannot easily update or modify it. Users would need to manually delete the LocalStorage file if necessary1.
